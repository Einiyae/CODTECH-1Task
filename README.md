**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project is a To-Do List Web Application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing fundamental front-end development techniques.

**Key Features**
Task Addition: Users can input tasks through a text box and add them to the list with a simple button click.
Task Completion: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking on them, which strikes through the task, indicating it’s finished.
Task Deletion: Each task has a "Remove" option, allowing users to delete tasks they no longer need.
Date and Time Display: Each task is tagged with the date and time it was added, providing a timestamp for reference.
Local Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the list persists across sessions. Even if the browser is closed or refreshed, the tasks will be retained.

**Technical Implementation**
HTML: The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including the input field for task entry, the button to add tasks, and the list where tasks are displayed.
CSS: CSS is used to style the application, providing a visually appealing and responsive design. The background features a gradient, and the layout adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent user experience across devices.
JavaScript: The JavaScript file is the core of the application's functionality. It handles the addition of tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks. JavaScript also manages the storage of tasks in the browser's local storage, allowing the application to remember the user's tasks between sessions.
User Interaction:
Users can type a task into the input field and click the "ADD" button to include it in their task list.
Once added, each task displays in the list with a timestamp and a "Remove" option.
Clicking on a task strikes through the text, indicating it is complete. Clicking the "Remove" option deletes the task from the list.
All interactions are saved in local storage, so tasks persist even if the user leaves the page or closes the browser.

**Purpose**
This project is a practical demonstration of how web technologies can be used to create a functional and interactive application. It’s a useful tool for learning and practicing front-end development, as well as for managing personal tasks in a simple, organized manner.
